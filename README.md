Use: "Change the settings" or "Set up the settings"
Why: "Configure" sounds technical. "Change" and "set up" are more straightforward.
Instead of: "Access the database"
Use: "Find the information" or "Look at the data"
Why: "Database" can be intimidating. "Find" and "look at" are more relatable.
Instead of: "Deactivate the function"
Use: "Turn off the function"
Why: "Deactivate" is formal. "Turn off" is very common.
Instead of: "Download the file"
Use: "Get the file"
Why: While download is becoming more common, Get is even more basic.
3. Abstract Concepts:

Instead of: "Optimize the workflow"
Use: "Make the work faster" or "Improve the work"
Why: "Optimize" is a business buzzword. "Faster" and "improve" are universally understood.
Instead of: "Synthesize the data"
Use: "Combine the information" or "Put the information together"
Why: "Synthesize" is academic. "Combine" and "put together" are more accessible.
Instead of: "Evaluate the performance"
Use: "Check how well it works" or "See if it works well"
Why: "Evaluate" sounds formal and complex. "Check" and "see" are more conversational.
Why This Works:

Familiarity: Simple words are more familiar and require less mental processing.
Directness: They convey the meaning directly, without unnecessary complexity.
Universality: They are less likely to be misinterpreted by people with different backgrounds.

## 7. How can using examples and visuals help in explaining complex concepts more clearly?
